/**
 * @brief The purpose of this singleton is to wake the render thread up, so it can process signals and slots.
 *
 * Why is it necessary?
 *      In Qt 6.4, the render thread goes to sleep after rendering is done. It is then unavailable for signals.
 *      However, alpine renderer relies on signals and slots being delivered to the rendering thread, e.g., for
 *      delivery of tiles (will be loaded onto the GPU), and for processing interaction events (which needs GPU
 *      processing to do a ray cast for getting the rotation point).
 *
 * How to use it?
 *      QQuickWindow::scheduleRenderJob is used to deliver a NoStage job, which calls QCoreApplication::processEvents.
 *      That one is not thread safe (at least not according to the docs), so it needs to be called from the main (GUI)
 *      thread.
